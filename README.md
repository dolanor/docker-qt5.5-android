# docker image for developing Qt on android

It was not easy to put in place, but thanks to different resources (mainly [keyvanfatehi](https://github.com/rabits/dockerfiles/blob/qt-desktop/Dockerfile) and [rabits](https://github.com/rabits/dockerfiles), I could manage it.
The Xvfb hack is pretty ugly, but hey, it is a solution.
And the new QInstaller Framework is not easy to grasp and to automate. Especially when new screen documentation are lacking ;).
